# ECE 4122 Final Project
# The goal of the individual project was to design and implement a 3D animated moving scene using custom classes, multithreading, and OpenGL with C++ programming language.
# •	Wrote a C++ user-interactive program that uses custom classes and third-party libraries to load, display, and move animated 3D objects.
# •	Rendered dynamic and static objects to the scene with textured images, lighting and material properties, and randomly changing lighting intensity.
# •	Utilized multithreading to perform calculations for each object’s randomized movements throughout the scene even as they collide with one another.
# Processed keyboard input from the user to perform certain functions like toggling object movement or adjusting the camera view.
# Provided the user with the ability to adjust the camera view, position, angle, and zoom.
